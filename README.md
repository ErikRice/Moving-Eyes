# Moving-Eyes
Moving Eyes is an interactive set of eyes that follow the movement of the mouse within the window of the browser. 
## How To
Once you open the page, you can move the mouse in any direction around the set of eyes to see it follow the mouse cursor.
### Future Additions:
* create a feature that makes the eyes close when the cursor gets too close to the eye
* add the rest of the facial features (nose, mouth, etc)
* change the cursor to a custom image
